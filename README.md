# Global Hack Week - Career Challenges

Welcome to my **Global Hack Week - Career** project repository! This repository contains a series of coding challenges and projects completed as part of Global Hack Week - Career, organized by Major League Hacking (MLH).

Each challenge is saved in its own folder with a dedicated `README.md` file that describes the problem, solution, and any additional instructions needed to run the code.

## Challenges

| Challenge Number | Description | Folder Link |
